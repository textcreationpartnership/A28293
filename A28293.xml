            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Impartial Reader,</head>
            <p>WHEN I publiſhed my Rule of Aſſize by Troy weight, I thought it would have prevented the former Complaints made by the Bakers againſt the Magiſtrates of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that I ſhould eſcape in my time their uſual Accuſations, of not being aſſized as the Statute directs: But I found my ſelf very much miſtaken; for on the contrary, in a little time after they charged me, (both before Government and Council, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament,) of having refuſed to conform to ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Council, and of having Aſſized them contrary to it, and at ſuch Rates and Prices, as they could not live by. Particularly by their Maſlin-Bread, which was never aſſized in <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of my Magiſtracy; and inſiſted poſitively, that by the Statute, they ought to be Aſſized by the ſecond higheſt price of Wheat, and not by the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> price as I had Aſſized them by.</p>
            <p>All theſe Charges I anſwered, and at a publick hearing in Council their Petition was diſmiſt, and afterwards rejected by the Commitee of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, after an exact Examination of the Statute of Aſſize, and of all my procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in aſſizing them; and my Rules of Aſſize were found ſo exactly like thoſe of the Statute, that I was deſired to print them again, and to add to it, the Aſſize by Avoir-dupoids, and by a Standard weight for Bread, aſſizable by a certain price, which I have accordingly joyned here together.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe publick Determinations, they have ſince perſiſted in the ſame Aſſertion, having an implicit belief for a certain Bakers Book, who pretends to have found out in the
<pb facs="tcp:55674:4"/> Statute the Word <hi>Second Price</hi> in ſtead of <hi>MIDDLE Price.</hi> Therefore I think it neceſſary to inſert here the Statute it ſelf, that every one may judge of their groſs miſtake.</p>

                     <hi>And it is to be known, that when a Baker in every quarter of Wheat, (as it is proved by the Kings Bakers,) may gain 4 d. and the Bran, and two Loaves for advantage; For three Servants, 1 d. ob.

                     <hi>The Aſſiſe of Bread (as it is contained in a writing of the Marſhalſey of our Lord the King delivered unto them,) may be holden according to the price of Wheat, that is to ſay, as well Waſtel, as other Bread of the better, ſecond and third ſort, ſhall be weighed as is aforeſaid by the
<pb facs="tcp:55674:4"/> MIDDLE price of Wheat, and the Aſſize or weight of Bread ſhall not be changed, but by ſix pence increaſing or decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the Sale of a Quarter.</hi>

                     <hi>By the conſent of the whole Realm of</hi> England, <hi>the Meaſure of our Lord the King was made, That is to ſay, that an Engliſh Penny, called a Sterling, round and without any clipping, ſhall weigh 32 Wheat Corns in the midſt of the Ear; and 20 d. do make an Ounce; and 12 Ounces one Pound; and 8 Pound do make a Gallon of Wine; and 8 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of Wine do make a</hi> London-Buſhel, <hi>which is the 8th. part of a Quarter.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Foraſmuch as in our Parliament holden at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>in the firſt Year of our Reign, we have granted that all good Statutes and Ordinances made in the times of our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors aforeſaid, and not revoked, ſhall be ſtill held, we have cauſed, at the requeſt of the Bakers of our Town of</hi> Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>that the Ordinances aforeſaid, by tenor of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſhall be examplified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Statute is the only in force in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the exact Aſſize of Breads and its Rules are ſo well diſgeſted, that it would be very difficult, to find a better or eaſier Method:</p>
                  <p>There is another Statute ordering that the price of Bread and Ale ſhall be according to the price of Corn.</p>
                  <p>And alſo the Statute of the <hi>Pillory</hi> and <hi>Tumbrell,</hi> for the puniſhing of <hi>Bakers</hi> and <hi>Brewers,</hi> which authoriſes Grand Juries to inquire, in theſe following Words: <hi>After how, the Bakers Bread in the Court do agree, that it is to wit, Waſtel and other Bread, after Wheat of the beſt, or of the ſecond, or of the third price. Alſo upon how much encreaſe or decreaſe in the price of Wheat, the Aſſize and weight of Bakers Bread ought to change. 51 1 H. 3.</hi>
                  </p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>There is not a Word here of Aſſizing by the ſecond price, but
<pb facs="tcp:55674:5"/> by the price of all the Wheat, and as the Mageſtrates ſhould find lawful after Inquiry made as the Statute <hi>Aſſiſa Panis</hi> do direct.</p>
            <p>There were Ordinances made before, and confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, or <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, in theſe Words: <hi>The Aſſiſe of Bread ſhall be kept according as it is contained in the writting of the Marſhalſey of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord the King; after the Sale of Wheat. That is to wit, the better, the worſe, and the worſt, as well Waſtel-Bread as other, of what ſort ſoever they be, ſhall be weigh'd according as it is ſaid of the Sale of the MEANER Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Word <hi>MEANER,</hi> is far from that of ſecond price of the beſt Corn, which the Bakers would be aſſized by, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies rather, the leaſt ſort but one, then the ſecond beſt.</p>
            <p>Serjeant <hi>Raſtal</hi> in his Abridgment of the Statute explaines it thus: <hi>The Aſſize of Bread be holden according to the Sale of Wheat, by the Sale of the MIDDLE Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Edmund Wingate</hi> in his new Abridgment of The ſaid Statute Paragraph VI. <hi>The Aſſize of Bread ſhall be rated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the MIDDLE price of Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not paraphraſe any further on the Statute, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it ſelf clearly enough. And if the Bakers will be aſſized by the ſecond price, they muſt chuſe thoſe places to bake in, where ſuch an Aſſize is eſtabliſhed by Cuſtom, or otherwiſe. But the Magiſtrates of <hi>Dublin</hi> have no other Rule but this Statute, and ought to conforme to it, according to their Oath, as Clerks of the Markets.</p>
            <p>The Corporation of Bakers taking Advice on this Point, and finding themſelves miſtaken in the Word <hi>SECOND</hi> and <hi>MID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DLE,</hi> took hold of the ſeveral names of Bread mentioned in the Statute, and White, Wheaten, and Houſhold, being not in the Statute, they thought it enough to maintain, that the Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb facs="tcp:55674:5"/> could not aſſize thoſe three ſorts of Bread by the Statute, upon which they got under the hand of their Councell his Opinion in that point of Law, adviſing them, to bake under Aſſize, and when, and as often, as the Magiſtrate ſhould take their Bread for want of weight, to Replevy the ſame, and by a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> bring their Cauſe to a Tryal.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enter into diſpute about Points of Law, I leave that to the Gentlemen at the Bar. I ſhall only mark, that by ſuch Means the Citizens would be very much wrong'd, as the beginning of it proved ſufficiently: For as ſoon as they agreed in their Hall to follow that courſe, they ſhut up their Shops, and ſold their light Bread in their Backhouſes, refuſed to take any Aſſize from the Magiſtrate, ſent no Bread to Market, and help'd no Body, but ſuch as they pleas'd, and at what Rate they thought fit. Now if the Magiſtrate had gone to their ſeveral Houſes, and ſeized all their light Bread, he would have brought on him more Suits at Law in the Year of his Magiſtracy, then there are Hours in the whole Year.</p>
            <p>But the Government of the City thought fit to take another courſe; They conſidered, that it was but an old Trick, acted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefore in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign, by the Bakers of <hi>Dublin:</hi> Therefore they followed the Example of their former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who paſs'd an Act of Aſſembly <hi>36 Elizabethae. That whereas the Country-Bakers gave more weight, then the City-Bakers, and yet the latter uſed their own Wills, as not to bake but at their own will and pleaſure, pretending they could not live, if they ſhould follow the Aſſize given by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Mayor.</hi> It was concluded and agreed, <hi>That from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, all ſuch of the Country-Bakers, and others that ſhould come in Market-Days with Bread to be ſold, ſhould have free Liberty to ſell the ſame, without Lett or Interruption of any whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>This Method had the ſame effect in this juncture, as it had then: For althô the Forreigners, and Country-Bakers, had been ſcatter'd, (as I ſhall prove in the Objection againſt a Tryal,) yet the encouragement given them by Proclamation, put the Freemen up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n thinking: And finding that ſome of the former had begun to bake, who found themſelves conſiderable Gainers, they preſently open'd their own Shops again, and fell a baking good, wholeſome, and aſſizable Bread, inſtead of the light glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Bread they had bak'd <hi>incognito,</hi> ſome Days before, and without their Mark, contrary to the Statute. From which we may eaſily inferr, that they are ſufficient Gainers by their Trades, and would have more Money in their Coffers, had not they ſpent ſo much as they have, in their continual Proſecutions againſt the Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>As to their pretended Point of Law concerning the Names of Bread mentioned in the Statutes, I believe, they will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any longer on it, when they are once ſatisfied, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by the Common Law has Power to aſſize Bread according to the value of the Corn, and that the Statute-Law confirms on him the ſame Authority, as appears by the ſeveral Statutes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſſize of Bread; and that beſides the ſame Bread we now call <hi>White, Wheaten,</hi> and <hi>Houſhold,</hi> are included in the Statute. I ſhall take them in Order, as they are in the Statute:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I. Waſtel Bread,</hi> in Latin, <hi>Libum,</hi> which ſignifies a Cake; ſome Interpret it to be a Cake made with Honey, a Cake made with Meal and Oyl; and ſome others, a Wafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; But <hi>Edmund Wingate</hi> in his Abridgment of the Statutes, calls it <hi>a ſort of ſmall Bread, out of uſe, and left out of Aſſize in Queen Elizabeth's Reign, as alſo</hi> Cocket Bread <hi>made of the ſame fine Flower, and</hi> Bultel.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. Cocket Bread,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Panis Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darius,</hi> is the Bread, made of Corn or Flower of leſs price
<pb facs="tcp:55674:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> than <hi>Waſtel,</hi> which ought to weigh more then the <hi>Waſtel</hi> by Five Shillings, <hi>viz.</hi> Seven Pounds one Shilling, which is the Rule of all the Aſſizes that ever were extant in <hi>England:</hi> and is called <hi>white aſſizable Bread,</hi> in all the Engliſh Ordinances of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the Records of <hi>Guild-hall, London, Anno 1311,</hi> there is a Duplicate of a Tryal made in <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time of <hi>3</hi> Quarters of Wheat; one of the beſt ſort, one of the ſecond, and one of the laſt, into White, Wheaten, and Houſhhold Bread.</p>
            <p>In the 12th Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, another Tryal was made after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>In the 8th Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, another Tryal was alſo made of <hi>3</hi> Quarters of Wheat, divided into four parts; one in White Bread, two in Wheaten, and one in Houſhold Bread; and this was when Sir <hi>William Buttler</hi> was Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and entred in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> in the Journal, folio <hi>238.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 34th Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno 1592,</hi> a like Tryal was alſo made, and an Order confirming the former Orders, appointing three ſorts of Bread only to be made, <hi>viz.</hi> White, Wheaten, and Houſhold: And therefore I conclude, that Cocket Bread, and White Bread is both of the ſame kind under two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Names.</p>

               <hi>IV. Bread</hi> made of the whole Wheat. There is no need of further explanation; for every Body knows that any Bread made of the whole Wheat, is neither White nor Brown, but partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates of both; and muſt of neceſſity be Wheaten, from the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, White and Brown. And the Words of the Statute marks what it is; <hi>That it ſhall weigh,</hi> (ſayeth the Statute,) <hi>a Cocket and a half,</hi> that is, one moiety of the White; and being a Cocket, one moiety of the Brown or Houſhold, which by the Statute is to weigh two Cockets, and both three Cockets, the moiety thereof is one and a half, the Wheaten participating of both in that proportion, or elſe Bread made of all the ſorts of Wheat mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which imports the ſame thing.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.

Throw ſo much into the Bargain.</hi> And the Engliſh Dictionary renders it, <hi>Bread of Advantage, or over Meaſure, Advantage, or over weight.</hi> The Statute explains it in theſe Words, <hi>Bread of Treet ſhall weigh two Waſtels;</hi> which was very near the weight of Houſhold Bread, and almoſt of the ſame kind; being a little better than Houſhold, and ſomething worſe than Wheaten; and the difference ſo little, that none but a Baker could diſcern it; and therefore it was left out of Aſſize. This is one of thoſe ſorts of compounds of Bread, I do mention in my Exceptions againſt a Tryal to be made by refined Bakers.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI. Bread of common Corn,</hi> the Name bears its own Signification, Bread for the common, or Servant, or for the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. But at this Day the Bakers mix in it, all their ſhort Meal, which formerly was given to Horſes; and ſome of late have got the way to grind their very Bran ſo fine, that it incorporates into it, and ſtill call it Houſhold, or Bread of common Corn; but it is far from the true Subſtance of Bread of common Corn, or
<pb facs="tcp:55674:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> Houſhold, and none will believe, that ſuch a compound with Bran, can feed the poor People ſo well, as that of all common Wheat. But on the contrary, that for want of true Subſtance, Nature ſoon throughs it out, and therefore it rather purges then nouriſhes the Body, as the Lord Mayor told the Bakers lately; who, inſtead of excuſing themſelves, ſeemed to vindicate their ill doing, by an Impertinent Anſwer, <hi>That it would procure to His Lordſhip more Cuſtomers for his Apothecary Druggs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus vindicated the aſſizing of White, Wheaten, and Houſhold-Bread, it remains to prove that my aſſizing of Meſlin was according to Law, and neceſſary; and that I did it upon good ground, and not out of my own Will, as Maſter <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cocq</hi> did aſſert and complained of, both before the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in Parliament; althô in Truth he was the very Man with Maſter <hi>Richard Allen,</hi> who deſired me to aſſize that Bread.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who keep the Bills of Mortality, and Maſter <hi>Crook,</hi> the Printer, who has all my Aſſizes ſigned by Me, will juſtifie, that at the beginning of my Magiſtracy, and till the middle of <hi>November 1694,</hi> I aſſized only the White, Wheaten, Houſhold, and Horſe-Bread, (or Crutchlo) in Imitation of <hi>England.</hi> But on the 16th of that Month, at the Inſtance of Maſter <hi>William Cocq,</hi> (then Maſter of the Corporation,) and with the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Government, I made uſe of the Power, granted by Law, to the Magiſtrates, as Clerk of the Market, and by the Statute or Ordinances of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in theſe Words (mentioned before,) <hi>That as well Waſtel-Bread as other, OF WHAT SORT SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EVER THEY BE, ſhall be weighed or aſſized, according as it is ſaid of the meaner Wheat:</hi> And then, I did aſſize the Meſlin-Bread, according to the value of that ſort of Corn, and at the Aſſize of Houſhold-Bread, and I left off aſſizing Horſe-Bread, he telling me there was no ſuch Bread made here.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>As ſoon as I had laid down the Rod, the Corporation begun again their noiſie Complaints againſt the aſſizing of that Bread, &amp; then it was left out of Aſſize, and they were Incouraged to petition againſt Me, which they did; but I ſoon vindicated my ſelf, having full Authority by the Law for what I had done. And when this Matter is well conſidered, perhaps it will be thought fit to aſſize that Bread, (as I did,) and alſo Rye-Bread and Cruchlo, being the ſeveral ſorts of Bread for the Labourers, Spinners, and the Poor; who would be better fed with it, then with Potatoes, could they have it plenty, and at a cheap rate, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Rate of Aſſize according the value of the Corn.</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Bakers had incerted in their Petition ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why that Bread ſhould not be aſſized, for till they do ſo, I will ſtill inſiſt that Meſlin-Bread, (being of Corn ſo much cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then Wheat,) ought to weigh more then Houſhold, and that the generality of the poor People are much wrong'd in being obliged to pay for a Pound of Courſe Meſlin, (as black as Horſe-Bread,) as much as for the beſt Houſhold. And indeed it is a wrong to the whole Kingdom; for if Bread, which is the chief Subſtance for the poor Labourers, and Spinners, be kept at high rate, they muſt ſuffer very much, or get greater wages; and if ſo, the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories muſt raiſe, which is the very means to hinder their Sale abroad.</p>
            <p>As for the Allegation in their Petition, that they loſt <hi>2</hi> s. in a Quarter by baking at my Aſſize; that's ridiculous; for all my Aſſizes are exactly according to the price of Meſlin brought to the Magiſtrate, with the Samples of Wheat. And every Body knows, that Meſlin is generally ſold at a great rate; and ſome at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate then ſome Wheat; becauſe there is little or no Rye in it: But when the Bakers have it at home, they mix what Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Rye they think fit, which is a cheaper Corn, and which is not brought in Aſſize; So that when the Baker pays <hi>24</hi> s. a
<pb facs="tcp:55674:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> Barel for Meſlin, and <hi>12</hi> s. for Rye, and mixes it together, that Quarter coſt but <hi>36</hi> s, and by my Aſſizing, (by the full price of Meſlin,) they were allowed as much as if they had paid <hi>48</hi> s. for the Quarter of Corn. By which means they got <hi>12</hi> s. a Quarter beſides the <hi>6</hi> s. allowed by Cuſtom for baking a Quarter of Corn.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſtill remain in my firſt Opinion, that Meſlin, being the food of the Labourer, ought to be aſſized according to the price of that ſort of Corn. And that the Bread made of all Rye, which is (much cheaper then Meſlin,) ought to be brought under Aſſize; and alſo the Bread made of Cruchlo, being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of Beans, Peaſe, Wheat, and other Grains, which is a ſtrong wholeſom food for Labourers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all theſe ſorts of Bread the Magiſtrate may aſſize ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <hi>to Law, and the Ordinances, before mentioned, which authoriſes to Aſſize as well Waſtel-Bread, as others OF WHAT SORT SOEVER THEY BE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the laſt Act of Aſſembly, inviting the Country or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Bakers, to help the City with Bread, it is no new thing, the ſame having been done before, and at a time, that there was not ſo great a neceſſity as lately, when all Free Bakers had agreed together to leave off Baking; and to ſtarve the Inhabitants or gain their own Will.</p>
            <p>It was high time then, for the Government of the City to prevent ſo great an Evil, by all means poſſible and juſt. And the Bakers cannot juſtly blame the Magiſtrate, (after ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond attempt of their Corporation,) for Inviting, and protecting in the City, ſuch other Bakers, as might ſupply the Inhabitants with Bread, not only in that great extremity, but at all other times hereafter if the Corporation ſhould relaps.</p>
            <p>All what was done at that time of need, is both according to Law and the Cuſtom of the City. The Statute making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:55674:9"/> of Bakers Free or Unfree, but eſtabliſhes one Aſſize only for all Bakers, and for all ſorts of Bread in general: And by Cuſtom there is no other difference between them, but that the Unfree Bakers cannot open Shop without Licence from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City.</p>
            <p>This was lately the Caſe of ſome Roman Catholick Bakers, who for a while paid a conſiderable Quartradge to the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Liberty of Baking at the Freemens Aſſize. But at laſt being adviſed by Councell, and the Corporation having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Point ſeriouſly, they ſoon agreed together, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were admitted at Twelve Pence Quartradge, as Mr. <hi>Robert Jones</hi> the Unfree Baker declared before the Comittee of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>But by a certain Cuſtom of this City, the Country or Forrain Bakers were obliged to bake at <hi>2</hi> s. leſs allowance in a Quarter of Wheat then the Free Bakers: That I ſuppoſe happened in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; For <hi>Edmund Wingate</hi> obſerves, <hi>That there was a Proclamation Iſſued in her time, that Bakers, inhabiting in Corporate Towns, (in regard they pay Scot and Lot there,) are allowed J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>c Shillings in every Quarter of the MIDDLE priz'd Wheat for their charge in baking: And Country or Forreign Bakers only 4 Shillings.</hi> And there is an Act of Aſſembly of this City in the 36th Year of her Reign, which obliges the Country or Forreign Bakers to give an overplus in Aſſize.</p>
            <p>It remains now to Anſwer their laſt Objection, that they are not aſſized by the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> price of Corn; but that all the Corn is calculated together, and does not fall to the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> price. Their Error in that proceeds of their miſtake in the Words of the Statute, and want of Knowledge in Arithmetick.</p>
            <p>They ſuppoſe and affirm, that there is only Three prices of Corn, mentioned for Aſſize, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, Second, and Third Price,
<pb facs="tcp:55674:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> placing that Word <hi>Price</hi> for <hi>Sorts;</hi> the Statute anſwers them fully; <hi>Bread of Better, Second and Third Sort, ſhall be weighed by the MIDDLE price of Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wheat in thoſe Days, and ever ſince, was divided in three parcels, <hi>viz.</hi> All the Beſt ſort in one, the Second in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Worſt in another: But the firſt ſort was not ſold all at one rate, nor either of the two other ſorts; but according as they were generally ſold, the Report was made. Example:</p>
            <p>If the Beſt was ſold, ſome at <hi>30</hi> s, ſome at <hi>29</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, ſome at <hi>29</hi> s, the Report was at <hi>29</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d; and if the Second ſort was ſold, ſome at <hi>25</hi> s, ſome at <hi>24</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, and ſome at <hi>24</hi> s, the general Price was reported at <hi>24</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d; and if the Worſt was ſold at <hi>20</hi> s, ſome at <hi>19</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, and ſome at <hi>19</hi> s, the Report was at <hi>19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>; So that upon Enquiry of the price of Firſt, Second, and Third ſort of Corn, the Price being returned <hi>29</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, <hi>24</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, and <hi>19</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, they joyned altogether to find out the Price of the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> ſort, and the three ſumms amounting in all to <hi>73</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. they divided by <hi>3,</hi> and found in the quotient <hi>24</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, which is the Price of the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> ſort of Wheat.</p>
            <p>Here in <hi>Dublin</hi> they have an Aſſize as juſt and exact, and I think more to their advantage; for they are allowed the full value of the price of Corn, althô the Statute ſays that the Price ſhall not Riſe or Lower in Aſſize but by <hi>6</hi> d; and they well know, that I never abated them one Half Penny of the juſt price of the Corn bought.</p>
            <p>The Calculating of all the Corn together falls to the ſame <hi>MIDDLE</hi> Center, when divided in <hi>3</hi> parcells, and each parcel calculated by it ſelf, and then the <hi>3</hi> joined afterwards. The Clerk of Aſſize in <hi>Dublin</hi> may humour the Bakers in that particular, &amp; find no alteration: For when all the Corn is entred, and the Price ſet down, and ſworn before the Lord-Mayor, and thoſe who attends
<pb facs="tcp:55674:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Sword, let him reckon how many different prices of Corn is ſold that Day, and divide them in three, and call the firſt parcel Beſt ſort, the ſecond Worſe, and the third Worſt ſort, and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late each, and bring them to a certain Price, and then join the <hi>3</hi> Prices together, and divide them by <hi>3,</hi> he will find in his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient the Price of the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> ſort of Corn. And if he calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all the whole together, he will find the ſame. I have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both ways ſeveral times, and found no difference. I ſhall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert here the manner of that Aſſize which I made at <hi>Newhall</hi> on a Market-Day for <hi>Mr. Cook,</hi> the preſent Clerk of Aſſize.</p>

            <p>This I ſuppoſe, is ſufficient to ſatisfie all Impartial Perſons, that no wrong was ever intended, or done, to the Bakers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall add no more but a few Words in my own Vindication, and of all my Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the time of my Magiſtracy was ended, ſome of them, and their Emiſſaries, were Impudent enough, to Curſe me in all Places, Markets, Streets, and Ale-Houſes, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my face, and in my hearing; but I laugh'd at it, looking on them to be mad Men, as ſome realy are, when they have got a little too much Liquor.</p>
            <p>But finding that it availed them nothing to Curſe, they took another Courſe of Revenge, and reported, that the Maſter had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me a <hi>Giunea-Cake</hi> for doing nothing. When I heard it at firſt, I took it as a Joke, remembring that a Foreign Bakers Wife had told me once, that they could live very well by my Aſſize, had not the Maſter put them to vaſt Contributions for his Expences at Law, it came then to my Thoughts, that perhaps the Maſter might have charged ſomething on his Accompts for extraordinary ſecret Expences, and applied it to that uſe. Therefore I told Mr. <hi>William Cocq,</hi> who was Maſter at that time, and Mr. <hi>John Foreman,</hi> who was Maſter then, that ſomething of that kind had been Reported, and deſired them to clear themſelves of it: Which accordingly they did, and went before Mr. Juſtice <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſwore an Affidavit that they knew nothing of it, and that they, nor any one elſe of their Knowledge, had ever offered any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>But Malice went further, and ſome of their Revengeful Friends
<pb facs="tcp:55674:11"/> proclaimed at the Parliament-Houſe, that when Corn was at <hi>15</hi> s. the Quarter, I had given the Bakers an Aſſize at <hi>35</hi> s. The News was preſently brought to me by Mr. <hi>Twigg.</hi> I then told him, that ſuch Report was ridiculous, and that no Men of Sence would believe it; becauſe my Aſſizes were all given under my Hand to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Bakers, ſigned by Me, as alſo to Mr. <hi>Crook,</hi> who prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them all, which were ſufficient to prove the contrary. Beſides that, in my whole Year I never gave ſo high an Aſſize as <hi>35</hi> s; and in all that time, but <hi>3</hi> at <hi>15</hi> s, when Corn was ſold at <hi>7</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. a Barrel, <hi>viz.</hi> 15th and 22th <hi>February,</hi> and 18th <hi>May;</hi> and my Aſſizes then was but at <hi>21</hi> s. with the Allowance.</p>
            <p>I gave them all to Mr. <hi>Twigg,</hi> deſired him to do me the Favour to ſhew them to all the Gentlemen, as he thought might have given credit to ſuch a Malicious, and Falſe Report; and to challenge the Author of it, to ſhew ſuch an Aſſize of mine, to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf, or elſe to do me that Juſtice to own his Error, as a Gentleman ought to have done; but he has been ever ſince ſilent, and I leave the World to judge what he is.</p>

            <head>Some EXCEPTIONS Againſt a TRYAL, Demanded by the BAKERS.</head>
            <p>BEing required to make theſe Three Books of Aſſize publick, I think it will not he amiſs in this juncture of time, (that baking is ſlighted) for every one to conſult the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>aſſiza Panis,</hi> to find out whether the Bakers do it upon good Grounds, or by a Covetous Spirit, to advance their Fortunes the ſooner, and to a higher Degree then is convenient for the eaſe of the Labouring-Men, and the Poor, conſidering that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of allowance to the former, decreaſes the quantity of Bread that the latter ſhould have.</p>
            <p>An encreaſe of allowance is conſiderate in a City, a Shilling <hi>per</hi> Barrel amounting to above <hi>100</hi> l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> to ſuch as bakes <hi>40</hi> Barrels of Corn weekly; and if the Bakers could obtain a further allowance of <hi>2</hi> s. per Barrel, (as they have alledged they had,) it would bring a double profit, and treble to ſuch as Mr. <hi>Cox,</hi> who by report bakes <hi>60</hi> Barrels per Week.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:12"/>
            <p>I have acknowledg'd, and do believe, that according to the Statute, and Proclamations ſince publiſhed in <hi>England</hi> till the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for the encreaſe of their allowance from time to time, they may juſtly expect a further allowance, at this juncture; that an Ounce of Sterling is worth <hi>5</hi> s. <hi>10</hi> d. &amp; the preſent Barrel leſs then the <hi>Wincheſter</hi> by one Gallon &amp; <hi>38</hi> Cubical Inches, and that allowance, I think, may be of <hi>2</hi> s. per quarter.</p>
            <p>But this allowance is to be granted by the Chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors &amp; Privy-Councel, and not by the Magiſtrate ſingly; for if ſuch Power was divolv'd to him, and Bakers ſhould happen to be Mayors, or ſome other ſelfiſh Perſons, they might ſoon enrich that Corporation and oppreſs the People.</p>
            <p>For the vindicating of their leaving off baking, althô bound by their Charter, they do alledge that they cannot bake but with Loſs, and therefore deſires that a Tryal be made of a Quarter of mixt Wheat as they are aſſized by. I muſt acknowledge, I ever was againſt ſuch Tryal; becauſe I do not believe, that any one, can do it exactly who is not a perfect Baker; and none in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> was admitted to make ſuch Tryal, but the Kings Bakers, who durſt not favour the Corporation, for fear, leaſt ſome of the Trade ſhould diſcover the fallacy, and make them looſe their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; But here all Bakers are engaged by their own particular Intereſt, and Sworn for the Good of their Corporation. What could other Perſons do, that knows neither the Quality of Corn, nor what each Sort may produce; nor how it muſt be milled, or fifted, or ſorted afterwards for the beſt Advantage; nor how to prepare the Dough, nor how to bake it. The profit, I think, muſt conſiſt in thoſe things, and to know the Quantity of Flower, that may be abſtracted for White particularly, which brings the moſt profit, and takes leſs Weight; and how much for Wheaten; and what of the Remainder may ſerve for Houſhold; and what further Advantage may be made by the Bran, either in ſelling of it, or
<pb facs="tcp:55674:12"/> grinding it to mix with other courſer Bread. I have an Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Belief, that the grand Tryal on which the Statute <hi>aſſiza Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> was grounded, was a true and juſt Aſſize, and that therefore the Bakers had then a ſufficient allowance thereby for baking: And have had further allowance to <hi>6</hi> s. the Quarter ſince; which was judged to be ſufficient when granted. And here we muſt obſerve that the meaſures of Wheat were calculated by ſuch Weight, as might enable the Bakers to bake with profit enough, and the Bran over and above. The Quarter of Wheat <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> meaſure was then fixed one with the other at <hi>544</hi> pounds, <hi>4</hi> ounces <hi>16</hi> penny weight Troy, or <hi>448</hi> pounds Avoir-du-poids, and all Aſſize s were calculated accordingly. I heard that the Bakers deſired that a Tryal ſhould be made of a Quarter of Wheat of the Tole-Corne, which is mixed of all ſorts, and to bake it all in good Houshold Bread. But I believe it was a jeſt, elſe it ſhould be named a Fallacy; for by ſuch a Tryal the Bread made would not produce ſo much as the Corn coſt. This may be eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Aſſize inſerted in the Statute <hi>51 H. 3.</hi> Where you will find that Houshold Bread is to weigh in its proportion as much as the Corn in toto, Example:
<q>3 Quarters of Corn aſſized at 4 hundred weight a piece makes 12 hundred in toto, and if the ſame did coſt, viz. the beſt 30 s. the middle 20 s. and the laſt 10 s. and aſſized by the middle price 20 s. and the Baker bound to give the like, weight in Houshold as the Corn weighs, viz. 4 hundred, which at 5 s. comes to the middle price of 20 s. If he be ſuch a fool, as to mix the whole, and make it all Houshold, and ſell it as the Aſſize bindeth, at the rate of the middle Corn, he cannot get a Farthing for baking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore ſuch a Tryal is ridiculous.</q>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But if the Baker keeps the <hi>3</hi> ſorts of Corn unmixt, and draws out of the <hi>1200, viz. 400</hi> for Houſhold, he has to <hi>20 s.</hi> of Bread, and <hi>300</hi> of Wheaten, brings as much, which makes <hi>40 s.</hi> and <hi>200</hi> of White produces the ſame, as the <hi>400</hi> Houſhold, which makes the firſt coſt, and theſe <hi>4. 3</hi> and <hi>2</hi> Hundred makes but <hi>900,</hi> So that the Baker has <hi>300</hi> Weight of Flower and Bran left to himſelf for his Profit, and <hi>6 s.</hi> Allowance.</p>
            <p>I know they will Anſwer, that my Propoſition is not certain, and that there cannot be <hi>200</hi> weight of White in the <hi>1200,</hi> nor <hi>300</hi> of Wheaten, and therefore will inſiſt for a Tryal, to which I have no further to reply, but that I do really believe, that it will be as difficult for a private Man, who knows not the Art of Baking, to make the beſt of ſeveral ſorts of Corn, as to another who never underſtood Mettals, to mix them ſo as to bring them to ſeveral Standards, for the beſt Profit, or to judg afterwards of their Qualities, when once allayed according to Art.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is with the Bakers; for when they have ſorted their <hi>3</hi> Quarters or <hi>1200</hi> weight of Meal, and placed <hi>200</hi> for White, <hi>300</hi> for Wheaten, and <hi>400</hi> for Houſhold; If they mix half a Hundred of the Wheaten to the <hi>200</hi> of White, and the like of the Houſhold to the Wheaten, and as much of the remaining part or Fine Bran to the Houſhold, who ſhould be judg of this mixture but themſelves, who are the God-Fathers of the Bread, and gives it what Name they pleaſe; as ſome Goldſmiths who have called Sterling a ſecond ſort of Silver, allayed with one fifth part of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, althô the Sterling is not to bear above the <hi>20th</hi> part of allay. All theſe Mixtures add allways to the profit of the Bakers.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude that advantageous Tryal for the publick Good cannot reaſonably be expected from them, who are Sworn for the Good of their Corporation, and naturally inclined to procure to themſelves and Families, all the Advantage poſſible; nor that they ſhould teach in a Day, (and for nothing) an Art they have laboured ſo long to learn, and diſcover all their Miſteries at once,
<pb facs="tcp:55674:13"/> to their diſadvantage. But I hope, that after a ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, they will ſeek for their right by the uſual Methods that have always been obſerved in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and continue their ſupplying this Great City with good and wholſom Bread, according to Aſſize, and as they are bound by their Charter.</p>
            <p>When I publiſhed theſe few Exceptions, I thought they had been ſufficient for to ſatisfie all Perſons, that there was no need at all of a Tryal; for it appears plainly enough by the Statute, and the Allowance granted to the Bakers, that they are ſufficient Gainers. But none having conſulted the Statute, and Mr. <hi>Cocq</hi> having prevailed for a Tryal, and for ſuch a Tryal that by bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Quarter of Wheat, the Bread made of it, brought leſs by <hi>4</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d, then the Corn coſt, (as they reported.) I think my ſelf obliged to enlarge a little more.</p>
            <p>At the time that Mr. <hi>Cocq's</hi> Tryal was made, an Unfree-Baker made another of a Quarter of Wheat at the ſame Aſſize, and made of the Bread ſeaven Shillings ſix Pence more, then the Corn coſt, which will be proved upon Oath if doubted of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no need to allow the Free-Bakers, to make any further Tryals.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cocq</hi> made a great Noyſe in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> pretending, that theſe few Exceptions were all Erronious, and that I had wrong'd the Bakers. Had he mention'd, in what particular I had anſwered him there; for I expected their Thanks, and not their Reproaches, being that they tend generally to the Advantage of the Corporation.</p>
            <p>I made them ſhort, and upon general Heads, not thinking that they would oblige me to deſcend to Particulars and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel their Diſingenious Contrivances, for attaining their end, by a Tryal, being not willing to expoſe them. But Maſter <hi>Cocq</hi> having made his Challenge ſo publickly, I ſhall endeavour to make good my poſitive Aſſertion, <hi>That the Bakers are ſufficient Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that a Tryal by them is neither ſure nor neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:14"/>
            <p>I ſhall prove the ſame, firſt by the Statute it ſelf, and ſecondly by their proceeding; Since I made publick the Book of Aſſize by Troy-weight:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I<hi rend="sup">mo</hi>.</hi> The Statute <hi>Aſſiza Panis</hi> fixes the Aſſize, by a Quarter of Wheat of Wine-meaſure, which is ſhort of the full Weight of a Quarter of Corn; the Statute leaving the overplus to the Baker, as a benefit for baking. This is explained very clearly in the Statute, as followeth. <hi>By the Conſent of the whole Realm of England, the Meaſure of our Lord the King was made,</hi> (That is to ſay,) <hi>that an Engliſh Penny called a Sterling, round and without Clipping, ſhall weigh 32 Wheat Corns in the Middes of the Ear, and 20 Pence do make an Ounce, and 12 Ounces one Pound, and 8 Pound do make a Gallon of Wine, and 8 Gallons of Wine do make a Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Buſhel, which is the eighth part of a Quarter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is then plain, That the Meaſure uſed for Aſſize, was the Wine-Meaſure, but the Meaſure by which the Corn is ſold, is another, which we call <hi>Ale</hi> or <hi>Wincheſter Meaſure;</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that the Wine-Gallon contains, only <hi>231</hi> Cubical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Ale-Gallon or Wincheſter contained then <hi>282,</hi> and therefore there was <hi>51</hi> Cubical Inches in that Gallon, or <hi>3246</hi> Cubical Inches more in a Quarter of Wheat by <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Meaſure, then by the <hi>London</hi> or Wine-Meaſure, which is <hi>11</hi> Gallons and a half, and <hi>21</hi> Cubical Inches.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who will make the Experience, may weigh a full Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wheat in the Market, and try the Difference, adding to it the <hi>2</hi> Gallons and <hi>76</hi> Cubical Inches taken off, from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Meaſure, by the late Act of Parliament.</p>

            <p>This Weight being the Money-Weights, of which there are hardly ſo many in the whole City, as would weigh a Quarter of Wheat, it muſt be reduced into Avoir-du-poids Weight by the Rules of the coequality of both Weights, which you have here In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and by which you'll find that <hi>512</hi> Pounds Troy, is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>406</hi> Pounds Avoir-du-poids. And therefore the Aſſize is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated as if a Barrel ſhoud weigh only <hi>203</hi> Pounds, or <hi>14</hi> Stones and a half, and the Quarter <hi>406</hi> Pounds, or <hi>29</hi> Stones. What it weighs over and above, is a Profit to the Baker.</p>
            <p>That Standard was never altered ſince, and the Aſſize was always made by it; but the Standard of the Corn ſold in the Market, was otherwiſe, as we ſee by the Statute made here, <hi>12 Elizabethae, The Buſhel for Wheat, Rye, Meſlin, Peaze, and Beans, to contain 16 Ale-Gallons, and the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel for Malt, Oates, and Barley, 20 Ale-Gallons, and the Buſhel (or half Barrel) for Bread-Corn to be received ſtrik'd, without heap, and the Buſhel of Malt is to be lay'd and
<pb facs="tcp:55674:15"/> preſs'd down, juſt with the Brim of the Buſhel after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Manner of meaſuring Malt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Meaſures were only eſtabliſhed for the County of the City, and County of <hi>Dublin,</hi> County of <hi>Catherlagh,</hi> County of <hi>Lowth,</hi> the <hi>Kings County,</hi> County of <hi>Meath,</hi> County of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> County of <hi>Wexford,</hi> County of <hi>Weſt-Meath,</hi> and the <hi>Queen's County.</hi> Therefore the Aſſize of <hi>Dublin</hi> could not be a Rule for any other Parts of the Kingdom; But now it may be ſo hereafter, there being but one Meaſure throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This proves ſufficiently, that the <hi>Dublin</hi>-Bakers cannot be Looſers by the Aſſize made here, our Barrel of Corn weighing more then <hi>14</hi> Stones and a half, which is the Weight of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of Aſſize, eſtabliſh'd by the Statute. And therefore there is no need of a new Tryal.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now Inforce this by proving that according to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize eſtabliſhed by the Statute <hi>Aſſiza Panis</hi> they gain ſufficiently.</p>
            <p>That will be found by any of the Aſſizes, calculated exactly, obſerving the Weights of a Quarter of Wheat, which generally weighs, <hi>viz.</hi> Beſt <hi>36</hi> Stones, Worſe <hi>34</hi> Stones, and Worſt <hi>32</hi> Stones, whereof the <hi>MIDDLE</hi> is <hi>34</hi> Stones, or <hi>476</hi> Pounds, or <hi>7616</hi> Ounces Avoir-du-poids, which is <hi>6949</hi> Ounces <hi>12</hi> Penny-weight Troy.</p>
            <p>It is indifferent what Aſſize is choſen for a proof, being all equal, but for the eaſe of thoſe, who are not expert in this way of Calculation, and for preventing Fractions, I ſhall take the Aſſize of Bread when Wheat is ſold at <hi>27</hi> s. a Quarter, and <hi>6</hi> s. allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Baker, which brings it to <hi>33</hi> s, and divide a Quarter of Wheat in three Parts, that is to ſay, that the Baker ſhall furniſh <hi>9</hi> s. of White Bread, <hi>9</hi> s. of Wheaten, and <hi>9</hi> s. of Houſhold to repay himſelf his firſt coſt, and keep all the reſt for his charges in baking.</p>

            <p>By the Weight of Corn they have <hi>6949</hi> Ounces <hi>12</hi> Penny of Wheat, Troy weight; and they are to deliver for the <hi>27</hi> s. they paid for the Corn, <hi>4981</hi> Ounces and a half only. Therefore they have <hi>1968</hi> Ounces and <hi>2</hi> Penny remaining for their charges and profit in baking, which is very near one Third Part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no need to allow 'em any further Tryal.</p>
            <p>And if they be allowed eight Shillings, in ſtead of ſix, there will be leſs need of it.</p>
            <p>I do not mention the great Profit they have by baking <hi>Meſlin, Rye, and Crutchlo-Bread,</hi> at what Weight they pleaſe, becauſe I hope they will be brought under Aſſize.</p>
            <p>Nor the benefit they have by baking Twice the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Wheat in Week-Days, then is ſold in Market-Days, where the Price is inhanſed by them:</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:16"/>
            <p>This was proved before the Committee of the Honourable Houſe of Commons: For all the Corn lodged at Mr. <hi>Coſſarts,</hi> and in the Malt-Houſe at <hi>Dolphins-Barn,</hi> was bought for leſs then <hi>40</hi> s. a Quarter, but the firſt was baked when the Aſſize was at <hi>58</hi> s, and if the other was kept longer, they got more, the Aſſize having riſen continually ſince, and indeed the Quantities of Corn has been multiplied ſince in that Place and in others; but this may be prevented.</p>
            <p>Nor the benefit they have by the overplus in Meaſure, which they get from the Country-men, becauſe it is properly a gift to them.</p>
            <p>Nor their Ingroſſing of Corn in the Country, becauſe they advance Money for it, and run the hazard of a change.</p>
            <p>Yet all theſe are advantages to the Rich Free-Baker, which the poor Unfree, or Foreigner has not, and yet gains ſo ſufficiently, that he is content.</p>
            <p>Therefore I conclude, that the Free-Bakers muſt of neceſſity gain more, and that no Tryal ought to be allow'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2<hi rend="sup">do</hi>.</hi> Conſidering their Contrivances for obtaining a Tryal to be made with the Aſſiſtance of the Maſter and Wardens of the Corporation. I do not think that it ought to be allowed them.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I had laid down the Rod, they prevailed, that Meſlin-Bread ſhould not be aſſized, which has continued to this Day, and by which means they have been great Gainers, and therefore had no need to complain or to deſire a Tryal.</p>
            <p>They at the ſame time contrived to have ſuch an Aſſize, for Foreigners, (or Unfree-Bakers,) as could not but deſtroy them, having no Allowance granted them, but on the contrary bound to allow <hi>3</hi> Pound weight of Bread in a <hi>12.</hi> Penny Loaf of Houſhold Bread, more then the Freemen, ſo that they could not bake without Looſing all their Labour and Charges in baking.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:16"/>
            <p>This made ſeveral Unfree-Bakers join together, to ſeek for relief, and at laſt the moſt conſiderable among them, were admitted by the Corporation to bake at their Aſſize. Then they joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but this ſevere Aſſize continuing afterwards from <hi>Mich. 1697</hi> to <hi>Mich. 1698,</hi> all the poor Unfree-Bakers were forced to leave off, and ſome to go away, and others to apply to other ſorts of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, or to ſerve as Journey-men, and this they endeavour'd to continue ſtill, but were prevented, when this was made known to our preſent Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>At that juncture of time, they rejected to take the Aſſize from the Magiſtrate, pretending they would bake no longer, and accordingly ſhut up their Shops, left off buying of Corn themſelves, but yet imployed their Millers, and others to buy for 'em, and bak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privately for whom they pleaſed, and at what Aſſize they thought fit. And perhaps would have continued to this Day, had not ſome few Perſons taken upon them to bake, and prove that they had Profit enough by baking at the Aſſize and Allowance, given by the Magiſtrates. And this ſeems to be a ſufficient Reaſon that a Tryal ſhould not be granted to be made by them.</p>
            <p>Their harraſſing at the ſame time, thoſe few new Bakers, ſeizing their Bread, when no Aſſize was proclaimed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and Bread only made for the preſent Supply, of thoſe they would not ſerve with Bread, and of a ſufficient Aſſize for that time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>7</hi> Twelf Penny Loaves they reſtored, wanting but <hi>6</hi> Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces after being kept <hi>15</hi> Days, proves ſufficiently their deſign of forcing for a ſubtil Tryal to gain an extraordinary Allowance to the Prejudice of the Poor, and for that Reaſon none ſhould be granted to them.</p>
            <p>The very Contrivance of making Mr. <hi>Cocq</hi> a grand Jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to procure a Tryal by his earneſt Solicitations to his Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was ſufficient for denying him ſuch Requeſt.</p>
            <p>I muſt in this place mark, that they had no right at that
<pb facs="tcp:55674:17"/> time to ſeize any Bread at all, much leſs in a Houſe; for no Bread ought to be ſeized, but what is expoſed for ſale in Shops, or in the Market, or ſuch as has been ſold for Bread of Aſſize, and proves light.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrate himſelf, or Grand Juries, cannot in juſtice ſeize Bread under the Weight of Aſſize, if kept by the Baker, by Reaſon of a miſtake of his Servants, in making the ſame too light, and he has (no doubt) Liberty to acquaint the Magiſtrate, and the Jury of the Miſtake, and to demand Liberty to ſell the ſame at an Under-rate, according to that of Aſſize; and ſuch a Licence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied: but if he ſhould ſell at a higher Rate, he is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the Magiſtrate, and ſubject to the Pillory.</p>
            <p>I could enlarge more for the preventing of the Tryal they ſo earneſtly deſire, but I think it is ſufficient to ſay, that when they ſaw, that the Government, and the City, were pleaſed to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Unfree-Bakers, who were beginning to bake; they of themſelves fell to work again, which they would never have done, had they been ſo great Looſers, as they pretended, and were ſure that none could bake at the Aſſize allowed by the Statute, but on the contrary would have ſuffered the Unfree-Bakers to go on, and ruin themſelves, by baking at that Aſſize, to ſupport their Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore I conclude, that there is no Reaſon to grant 'em any further Tryal.</p>

            <head>RULES FOR THE ASSIZE of BREAD; By Sterling-Money, and Troy-Weights. According to the Statute <hi>Aſſiza Panis.</hi> 51 H. 3.</head>
            <p>THe Statute takes no Notice of Troy-Weight, the Aſſize of Bread being Eſtabliſhed according to the currant Money of <hi>England,</hi> which had been Made and Stamp'd by ſome Genilemen called the <hi>Sterlings,</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt of England;</hi> and for that reaſon bear their Name to this day.</p>
            <p>It is to be ſuppos'd that they knew the Weights called <hi>Troy,</hi> having Coined all the Money according to that Standard. But the Coin has been exhauſted ſince, from time to time; the Ounce of Sterling being riſen by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> to <hi>2</hi> s. <hi>6</hi>d. by <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> to <hi>40</hi> d. by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> to <hi>45</hi> d. and by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>5</hi> s. which is now the Standard of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore for keeping the Aſſize at the juſt Standard limited by the Statute, they left off uſing the word Sterling, and in ſtead of a Penny, or a Shilling, or a Pound Sterling, they called the Penny, a Penny-Weight,
<pb facs="tcp:55674:18"/> and <hi>20</hi> Penny-Weight an Ounce, and <hi>12</hi> Ounces a Pound Troy; and accordingly the Aſſize of Bread has been made ever ſince. The Word <hi>Troy-Weight,</hi> (in Latin <hi>Libra Trojana</hi>) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as much as that of <hi>Sterling,</hi> being called by the name of the <hi>Trojans</hi> who made and uſed it, in all that part of <hi>Aſia the Leſs,</hi> called <hi>Phrigia,</hi> the Chief City whereof is <hi>Troy.</hi> From thence the <hi>Europeans</hi> took it, and Coined there Money by that Standard. In <hi>France</hi> they gave it another Name, calling the Pound a <hi>Marc.</hi> from the Latin <hi>Marca,</hi> and with us a Mark of Money weighing <hi>12</hi> Ounces.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> they call it <hi>Libra Romana,</hi> and contains the ſame Weight of <hi>12</hi> Ounces from the Latin <hi>Aſſis Aſſipuridium,</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Coin, a Pound.</p>
            <p>But for the better underſtanding of the Aſſize by Sterling-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and Troy-Weight, you have here a Table of the Coequality of Old Sterling-Money, and Troy-Weight, and the Sterling-Money now Currant in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>By this Table it is eaſie to apprehend, that the Money is three times the value, of what it was at firſt; but Troy-Weight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fixt, and therefore will be the rule of the following Table of Aſſize.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The Statute orders the Aſſize to be made, that when Corn is at <hi>1</hi> s. <hi>per</hi> Quarter, the Cocket or White Loaf of a Farthing ſhall Weigh <hi>7</hi> l. <hi>1</hi> s. Sterling, Old Standard Money, which is exactly <hi>84</hi> Ounces <hi>12</hi> Penny Weight, as you may ſee in the Table.</p>
            <p>But at this time it would be in vain to make an Aſſize by a Farthing Loaf, it being out of uſe: And to make one by a Half Penny would but increaſe this work and to no purpoſe, that of a Penny including both,</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore begin the following Table of Aſſize, by the Penny White, which is the rule of Aſſize; For the other ſorts, the Statute ordering that Wheaten Bread ſhall Weigh a Cocket and a half, that is, half more then the White; and the Houſhold two Cockets, that is, twice as much as the White Cocket. The Statute directs that the Aſſize ſhall not change, but by <hi>6</hi> d. in the Raiſing or Lowring of a Quarter of Wheat, therefore the Table will follow accordingly from Six Pence to <hi>200</hi> Six Pences Price.</p>
            <p>It alſo ordained, <hi>That when a Quarter of Wheat is ſold for 12</hi> d. <hi>the Farthing Loaf of White Cocket ſhall weigh 7</hi> l. <hi>1</hi> s. <hi>which is 84 Ounces 12 Penny Weight;</hi> So that the Half Penny is to weigh <hi>169</hi> Ounces <hi>4</hi> Penny weight; and conſequently the Penny Loaf <hi>338</hi> Ounces <hi>8</hi> Penny weight: But when Corn is ſold at <hi>6</hi> d. the Quarter, then the Penny White ought to weigh twice as much, <hi>viz. 676</hi> Ounces <hi>16</hi> Deniers.</p>
            <p>For the more eaſe in Calculating all Aſſizes, and avoid all Fractions, I reduced the <hi>676</hi> Ounces <hi>16</hi> Deniers, which is the weight of a Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

For if the White is to weigh a Pound, the Wheaten is to weigh a Pound and a half, and the Houſhold two Pounds.</p>

            <p>The uſe of theſe Tables of Coequality, is chiefly for the finding out the juſt equality of <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Avoir-du-poids Weight,</hi> to ſatisfie the Curious that both Aſſizes are alike.</p>
            <p>It has been proved by the Aſſize by <hi>Troy-Weight,</hi> that when a Quarter of Wheat is ſold for <hi>6</hi> d. the Bakers White Penny Loaf is to Weigh <hi>676</hi> Ounces, <hi>16</hi> Penny Weight, or <hi>13536</hi> Penny Weight, or <hi>323864</hi> Grains <hi>Troy.</hi> And by theſe numbers of Penny Weights or Grains, all Aſſize may be made without Fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by Dividing thoſe Numbers, by as many Six-Pences, as are in the Price of a Quarter of Wheat, and allowance to the Baker.</p>
            <p>The ſame method muſt be obſerved for the following Aſſize by <hi>Avoir-du-poids:</hi> But firſt of all, the Weight muſt be found by the Coequality of both, which may be done by the firſt Table Coequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by <hi>Troy Weight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt you muſt ſet down the <hi>676</hi> Ounces <hi>16</hi> Penny Weight, as in the Example following; according to ſuch Numbers as are in the firſt Column <hi>Troy,</hi> and may anſwer the <hi>676</hi> Ounces <hi>16</hi> Penny Weight, ſetting down firſt <hi>500</hi> Ounces, then <hi>100. 50. 20. 5.</hi> and <hi>1.</hi> and then <hi>10</hi> Penny, <hi>5</hi> Penny, and <hi>1</hi> Penny, as you ſee here. Afterwards look on the next Column <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> and place over againſt each of the <hi>Troy</hi> Numbers, that of <hi>Avoir-du-poids</hi> next to it, as to <hi>500</hi> Ounces <hi>Troy, 547</hi> Ounces <hi>7</hi> Drachms, <hi>41</hi> part of a Drachm, divided in <hi>73</hi> Grains. To a <hi>100</hi> Ounces <hi>Troy, 109</hi> Ounces <hi>4</hi> Drachms <hi>52</hi> Grains. To <hi>50</hi> Ounces <hi>Troy, 54</hi> Ounces <hi>6</hi> Drachms <hi>26</hi> Grains. To <hi>20</hi> Ounces <hi>Troy, 21</hi> Ounces <hi>7</hi> Drachms <hi>25</hi> Grains. To <hi>5</hi> Ounces <hi>Troy, 5</hi> Ounces <hi>3</hi> Drachms <hi>61</hi> Grains. To <hi>1</hi> Ounce <hi>Troy, 1</hi> Ounce <hi>56</hi> Grains. To <hi>10</hi> Penny Weight <hi>Troy, 4</hi> Drachms <hi>28</hi> Grains. To <hi>5</hi> Penny Weight <hi>Troy, 2</hi> Drachms <hi>14</hi> Grains. And to <hi>1</hi> Penny Weight <hi>Troy, 32</hi> Grains <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> add all theſe together, and you'l find that <hi>741</hi> Ounces <hi>5</hi> Drachms and <hi>43</hi> Grains <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> anſwers exactly <hi>676</hi> Ounces <hi>16</hi> Penny Weight <hi>Troy.</hi>

            <p>The ſaid <hi>741</hi> Ounces <hi>5</hi> Drachms, being Multiplied by <hi>8,</hi> which is the number of Drachms in an Ounce, brings with the odd <hi>5</hi> Drachms <hi>5933</hi> Drachms, which being alſo Multiplied by our <hi>73</hi> Grains (or ſo many parts of a Drachm) (ſo Divided) brings <hi>433152</hi> Grains <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> Coequal with <hi>323864 Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For avoiding all Fractions, and many Rules, take the ſame Method in this Aſſize, as in that by <hi>Troy-Weight,</hi> Divide the <hi>433132</hi> by the Number of Six-Pences you find in the Price of a Quarter of Wheat, and allowance to the Baker, and what you find in the Quotient, will be the Weight of a Penny White Loaf.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:27"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Corn is at <hi>6</hi> d. <hi>per</hi> Quarter, the Penny Loaf is to Weigh as aboveſaid <hi>433152</hi> parts of a Drachm divided in <hi>73</hi> Grains. Suppoſing then the Corn to be at <hi>12</hi> s. <hi>3. per</hi> Barrel, or <hi>24</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. the Quarter, and <hi>6</hi> d. allowance to the Baker, which makes <hi>30</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. or <hi>61</hi> Six-Pences. Divide the <hi>433152</hi> Grains by the <hi>61</hi> Six-Pences, and you'l find in the Quotient <hi>710O</hi> Grains, and <hi>52</hi> parts. Divide this by <hi>73</hi> Grains, and you'l find in the Quotient, <hi>97</hi> Drachms, <hi>19</hi> Grains, and <hi>52</hi> parts of a Grain. Divide this againe by <hi>8</hi> Drachms to make Ounces, and the Quotient will be <hi>12</hi> Ounces, <hi>1</hi> Drachm, <hi>19</hi> Grains, and <hi>52</hi> parts of a Grain, which is the weight of a Penny White Loaf, when Corn and allowance to the Baker is at <hi>30</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. <hi>per</hi> Quarter, and this is coequal with a <hi>11</hi> Ounces <hi>1</hi> Penny Weight, and <hi>55</hi> parts of <hi>61 Troy-Weight,</hi> which is the Weight of a White Penny Loaf by that Weight.</p>
            <p>Keeping this Method, all other Aſſizes may be ſoon Calculated, ſo that whoſoever will be ſo curious, as to look after my miſtakes, (or that of the Printer) may aſcertain all Aſſizes in a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>This is neceſſary for all Magiſtrates to know, elſe they may miſtake in Puniſhing the Bakers, for lack of Weight in their Bread, and the latter take advantage of the want of knowledge of the former, and Bake under Aſſize.</p>

            <head>RULES FOR ASSIZING OF <hi>White, Wheaten,</hi> and <hi>Houſhold-Bread;</hi> BY A Certain Standard Weight, for each kind of LOAVES. Aſſized in Money at a certain Price, according as the Rate of Corn Riſes and Falls in the Market. Calculated exactly, and made Coequal with the Weights, and Prices, preſcribed by the Statute <hi>Aſſiza Panis,</hi> 51. <hi>H.</hi> 3.</head>
            <p>THis way of Aſſizing the Bread, would require but little Calculation, could the Weight of Corn, and Price, be Regulated at the ſame time, according to the value of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Money, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> do: For every Firſt day of the Month, they have an account brought of all the Corn in their Dominions, and according to the Quantity, they value it at a certain Price, and every <hi>Monday</hi> they affix in the Market place the Weight, that the ſeveral ſorts of Bread ought to Weigh, and the Price; And if the Bakers do not Conform, and miſs in the Weight, the
<pb facs="tcp:55674:33"/> Diſcoverer has power to go with the Officer of the Market, to the Bakers Houſe to Seize all his Bread; the half whereof is for the Informer, the other for the Poor.</p>
            <p>In this Kingdom we are Bound by the Statute, to a certain Weight of a Quarter of Wheat, and by a certain Weight of the Quantity of Corn, which the Bread muſt Weigh, when at ſuch a Price, and alſo by our Currant Money Divided only in Shillings, or <hi>12</hi> Pences, or <hi>24</hi> Half Pence, or <hi>48</hi> Farthings, which is ſomething troubleſome becauſe of our Aſſize, which Riſes and Falls by odd Numbers and Fractions, and extendeth further then the Number of <hi>48</hi> Farthings; therefore we are neceſſitated to Divide our Farthing in Four Pieces, which we may call Deniers; and that may be eaſily done, and without charge.</p>
            <p>The other Aſſizes beginneth by a Suppoſition; when Corn is at <hi>6</hi> d. the Quarter, a Penny White Roll ought to Weigh ſo much: But that Suppoſition is only for Rule ſake, and not to be practiſed; becauſe the Bakers ſince that Statute, have Six Shillings allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and therefore if Corn ſhould ever fall ſo low as <hi>6</hi> d. a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ought to be Aſſized as if ſold at <hi>6</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. as they are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Aſſizes: And therefore a certain proportion of Money ought to be applied on every Six Pence that a Quarter of Wheat, and allowance to the Baker, amounts unto, and ſo exactly that when the Price of Corn Riſes or Falls by <hi>6</hi> d. that of the Standard Bread, may alſo Riſe and Fall accordingly by equal portions, as it doth by the Aſſize by <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> viz. from <hi>6</hi> d. to <hi>5</hi> l.</p>
            <p>The Rule of the Statute is, That a Quarter of Wheat ſhall be Divided in <hi>8</hi> Buſhels, or <hi>64</hi> Wine Gallons, and ſhall Weigh <hi>512.</hi> Pound, or <hi>6144</hi> Ounces, or <hi>122880</hi> Penny Weight, or <hi>3932160</hi> Grains <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore take the Number of <hi>64</hi> Gallons for Rule, (which is a full Quarter) and Divide my Shilling into as many
<pb facs="tcp:55674:33"/> parts, which obliges me to Divide the Farthing in <hi>4</hi> Deniers, there being but <hi>48</hi> Farthings in a Shilling; and ſo having <hi>192</hi> Deniers, the Third Part of which is <hi>64,</hi> I fix <hi>3</hi> Quarters of a Farthing on every Gallon of Corn, which Riſing, and Lowring in Price by Six Pence, ſhall alſo Riſe and Fall the Price of my Standard, by <hi>3</hi> Quarters on each Six Pence, which will anſwer exactly the Aſſizes by <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Avoir-du-poids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe that Corn be ſold at <hi>26</hi>s. and <hi>6</hi> s. allowance, which makes <hi>32</hi> s. or <hi>64</hi> Six Pences, each Six Pence bearing <hi>3</hi> Quarters, the <hi>64</hi> amounts to <hi>192,</hi> which Divided by <hi>4</hi> brings <hi>48</hi> Farthings which is a Shilling.</p>
            <p>Look on the Aſſize by <hi>Troy Weight</hi> at <hi>32</hi> s. Price of Corn, and allowance, and you will find that the Penny White is to Weigh <hi>10</hi> Ounces <hi>11</hi> Penny Weight and half, ſo that a <hi>12</hi> Penny Loaf muſt Weigh <hi>126</hi> Ounces, <hi>18</hi> Pence, or <hi>10</hi> Pound <hi>6</hi> Ounces, <hi>18</hi> Penny Weight. The Wheaten is to weigh half more, and the Houſhold twice as much: And theſe are our Three Standards for <hi>White, Wheaten,</hi> and <hi>Houſhold Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Aſſizes anſwers this exactly; I ſhall not trouble the Reader with the Proof of each; for it would make this Book too Voluminous, and every one may eaſily Calcutate them. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſtance few of them without Fractions.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the Corn and Allowance be Lowred to <hi>8</hi> s. or Sixteen Six Pences, the <hi>16</hi> times <hi>3</hi> Quarters is <hi>48,</hi> and <hi>48</hi> Deniers is <hi>12</hi> Farthings, or <hi>3</hi> Pence: Now as <hi>3</hi> Pence is the Fourth Part of <hi>12</hi> Pence, ſo is <hi>16</hi> the Fourth Part of <hi>64,</hi> therefore this Falls in proportion. On the contrary; ſuppoſing the Corn Riſes to <hi>40</hi> s. with the allowance, which is <hi>80</hi> Six Pences, Calculate <hi>80</hi> times <hi>3</hi> Deniers whic his <hi>240,</hi> the Fourth Part makes <hi>60</hi> Farthings or <hi>15</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55674:34"/> Pence, ſo that our Standard Riſes one fourth part more then that at <hi>32</hi> s. as alſo the Price from <hi>32</hi> to <hi>40</hi> s. Riſes a fourth part, and ſo doth all other Aſſizes, from Firſt to Laſt, as you ſee in the Table.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but ſome will ſay, that althô this way of Aſſizing be the beſt, and the moſt certain, and moſt uſeful, that yet it is not practicable, becauſe we have no ſuch ſmall Money as <hi>3</hi> Quarters of a Farthing. But this difficulty will be eaſily removed; for it is very eaſie, and without any charge to the King, to make <hi>4</hi> pieces for a Farthing, and to call them Quarters or Deniers.</p>
            <p>Such ſmall Money being very near the intrinſick value, and Authorized by the King, would be pleaſing to the People, and would paſs as Currant as Silver, both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>I remember that when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, was Petitioned to allow to the <hi>Blew-Boys-Hoſpital</hi> liberty of Coining Half Pences, as an advantage towards that Foundation; there were thoſe who are ſtill in being, that would have undertaken to Coin Small Money, one third part heavier then that now Currant, and give ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the Hoſpital: If the ſame was allowed, it would be not only an advantage to that Foundation, but a benefit to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Poor; for if in lew of a Half Penny there were <hi>8</hi> Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or <hi>8</hi> Quarters of a Farthing, he that has but Two Pence a day to diſtribute to the Poor, in lew of helping <hi>4</hi> with Four Half Pence, might diſtribute his Two Pence to <hi>32</hi> Poor Perſons.</p>
            <p>There is a Table of Aſſize of Bread in Money uſed in <hi>London,</hi> but it is only for a Peck Loaf of Houſhold Bread, which is to Weigh always <hi>17</hi> Pound <hi>6</hi> Ounces <hi>1</hi> Drachm <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> and never changes but by the Falling or Riſing of the Quarter of Wheat by <hi>2</hi> s. So that in caſe an Aſſize be at <hi>28</hi> s. and Corn Riſes to <hi>28</hi> s. and <hi>6</hi> d. and <hi>29</hi> s. and <hi>29</hi> s. and <hi>6</hi> d. yet the Price never Riſes; by which the Bakers look always <hi>6</hi>d. or <hi>1</hi> s. or <hi>18</hi> d. in a Quarter of Wheat; till the Price comes to an even
<pb facs="tcp:55674:34"/> Sum: This doth not anſwer the Statute, and therefore ought not to be practiſed here, nor can we bind the Bakers to ſuch an Aſſize. And on the contrary, if the Price ſhould fall to <hi>27</hi> s. ands <hi>6</hi> d. or <hi>27</hi> s. or <hi>26</hi> s. and <hi>6</hi> d. and the Bakers ſhould contrive to keep it at thoſe odd Prices, they ſhould be continually Gainers, of as much as the odd Price amounts unto, over and above the even Shillings Prices: Beſides that, if an Unfree Baker was bound to ſuch Standard, and to convert all in Houſhold, he could not Bake but at a great Loſs.</p>
            <p>They have alſo a Table of Aſſize by <hi>Troy-Weight,</hi> wherein they have omitted all the Aſſizes by <hi>6</hi> d. and all the Fractions in all other Aſſizes by Shillings, ſo that in caſe the Baker tranſgreſs, his puniſhment muſt be Arbitrary, for they cannot plead the Statute againſt them, none of their Aſſizes anſwering the Rules preſcribed by that Act.</p>
            <p>There is another ſmall Aſſize incerted in a Book of Sir <hi>Samuel Morland</hi>'s Works, which I believe gave birth to the former; it is Calculated by the Buſhel of Wheat, when at <hi>2</hi> s. and Riſes by <hi>3</hi> d. in each Aſſize, therefore <hi>2</hi> s. anſwers <hi>16</hi> s. a Quarter, <hi>2</hi> s. <hi>3</hi> d. anſwers <hi>18</hi> s. a Quarter. 2 s. <hi>6</hi> d. anſwers and <hi>20</hi> s. and ſo on to <hi>9</hi> s. a Buſhel, which is <hi>3</hi> l. <hi>12</hi> s. the Quarter; but all Aſſizes that falls to One, Two, or Three odd Six Pences he left out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the difficulty of the Fractions.</p>
            <p>His Firſt Aſſize of <hi>2</hi> s. <hi>per</hi> Buſhel requiring Three other Aſſizes before his Second at <hi>2</hi> s. <hi>3</hi> d. for all the Aſſizes muſt Riſe or Fall by <hi>6</hi> d. ſo that he ſhould have made all Aſſizes by <hi>2</hi> s. and the <hi>¾</hi> part of a Farthing, <hi>2</hi> s. Farthing and <hi>½,</hi> and <hi>2</hi> s. <hi>3</hi> Farthings <hi>¼,</hi> which is the <hi>16th</hi> part of a <hi>6.</hi> Penny, as <hi>2</hi> s. a Buſhel is the <hi>16th</hi> part of <hi>16</hi> s. a Quarter: The want of thoſe Fractions makes the Aſſize uſeleſs, and contrary to the Statute, and of the ſame prejudice as the former.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55674:35"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Edmund Wingate</hi> in his Abridgment of the Statutes mended that miſtake in ſome meaſure in his Aſſize, which begineth by the price of Corn when at <hi>19</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. and obſerves all along the Aſſize by odd Six Pences and Shillings, but he leaves out all the Fractions in his Diviſions of the Weight, that the Penny White Loaf ought to Weigh, which amounts to <hi>24</hi> times as much in the Twelve Penny Houſhold; which is the Bread that requires the moſt exact Weight. Beſides there are ſeveral Aſſizes wherein he miſtook. I ſhall mention one for example, When Corn is at <hi>58</hi> s. <hi>6</hi> d. <hi>per</hi> Quarter, he Calculates it, That the Penny White is to Weigh <hi>5</hi> Ounces <hi>14</hi> Penny Weight, whereas it ought to Weigh <hi>5</hi> Ounces <hi>15</hi> Penny Weight, and <hi>81</hi> part of <hi>117,</hi> which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled makes the Aſſize of the Twelve Penny Houſhold ſhort by <hi>40</hi> Penny Weight and <hi>72</hi> parts of <hi>117</hi> which is above <hi>2</hi> Ounces, all his following Aſſizes are like this; and therefore does not anſwer the Statute, and ought not to be followed.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Powell</hi> an Engliſh Baker, has alſo Printed a Book of Aſſize, in favour of his Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> which has been the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Block of ſeveral of our Clerks of Aſſize here. The Rules he has taken I know not; but as to his Aſſertions concerning the Aſſize for Foreigners they are altogether contrary to the Statute <hi>Aſſiza Panis;</hi> and I really believe intended here on purpoſe to Ruin them; for none can Bake by that falſe Aſſize, but muſt looſe very conſiderably: And if the Magiſtrates ſhould Authorize it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as the Free-Bakers deſire ſo earneſtly, then indeed neither the Unfree-Bakers, nor Foreigners, nor Country Bakers, would be able to live by their Calling: Leſs then nothing being allowed for Baking by that falſe Aſſize. But the Act of Parliament will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them againſt ſuch Oppreſſion, if ever the Free-Bakers ſhould prevail again to have it impoſed on thoſe poor People.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A PETITION of the Corporation of BAKERS. Preſented to the LORD MAYOR, SHERIFFS, COMMONS, and CITIZENS, of the City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> at <hi>Eaſter</hi> Aſſembly, 1699.</head>
            <p>THE Allegations in the ſaid Petition being all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Suppoſitions needs no Anſwer. All what they ſeem to requeſt is, that the City would be pleaſed to revoke their late grant to Unfree-Bakers, and to allow the Corporation ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in every reſpect, as all other Corporations have.</p>
            <p>As for the revoking the Act paſt for the Encouraging the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free Bakers (which they call Foreiners) it cannot conſiſt with the Honour of the City at this juncture of time, that they have been at vaſt charges to take Houſes, and build Ovens, and buy all Utencils, wherein they have ſpent their Stock; and by their generous care ſuplied the City with good and wholſom Bread, and prevented the Famiſhing of many poor People. Had the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
<pb facs="tcp:55674:38"/> prevented that by Petitioning in time, before the former had ſet up by virtue of that Act, they had no doubt received all the favour they could juſtly expect. And if they do Bake, as they ſay, all good and wholſom Bread, and the Unfree all Currupt, Unſound, and unwholſom Bread, as the former alledges in their Petition, the latter need not be deſtroyed by Act of Aſſembly, for they'll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves, for no body will leave off buying good Bread from the skilful Free Baker, to go to the unskilful Unfree Baker for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, Unſound and Unwholſom Bread.</p>
            <p>They have joyned to their Petition a Paper, the Copy of which followeth.</p>
            <p>An exact account of two Barrels of Wheat, Bak't into Houſhold Bread, according to the Lord Mayors Aſſize, by the Grand Jury of the County of the City of <hi>Dublin, February</hi> the <hi>10th. 1698.</hi>

            <p>The above Tryal being made by the Order of the ſaid Grand Jury, by me the day above ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vin. Bradſton.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:55674:38"/>
            <p>Several days before this Tryal, the Exceptions made againſt it were Printed, and delivered to Sir <hi>Michael Mitchel</hi> Foreman of that Grand Jury, and to Mr. <hi>Thwaits</hi> (one of them) who have not Signed the Report, by reaſons beſt known to themſelves; and every body who will read the Exceptions againſt that Tryal, will eaſily judge of the Fallacy of it, and the Diſingenuity of the Bakers.</p>
            <p>This Book explains all the Rules for Baking according to the Statute of exactly, that I refer the Reader to it. I ſhall only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Tryers by their very Aſſize, taking all for granted as to the price, charge, weight of Corn, Bran, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and quantity of Bread made of it according to Aſſize; which was that day <hi>12</hi> Ounces &amp; the Penny Houſhold by <hi>Avoir-du-poids,</hi> the rule of their Aſſize in this Tryal. According to which the Twelve Penny Loaf ought to weigh <hi>150</hi> Ounces, &amp; the <hi>46 ½</hi> Twelve Penny Loafs <hi>6975</hi> Ounces, or <hi>435</hi> Pound <hi>15</hi> Ounces, by which I muſt obſerve firſt of all, that their Meal being by their Tryal <hi>3</hi> Quintals a Quarter and <hi>7</hi> Pound makes only <hi>371</hi> Pounds, ſo that it appears that in Barm, Water, and Salt, the weight of the Bread encreaſes <hi>64</hi> Pound <hi>15</hi> Ounces, which is a great advantage to the Baker.</p>
            <p>Should I enlarge on this matter, it would require as many Sheets as are already Printed; and whats done anſwers them ſufficiently. I ſhall only ſay that at the ſame time this Tryal was made, an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free Baker made another after the ſame manner, and got above <hi>7</hi> s. profit, and would have got much more, had he followed the Rules of Baking according to Aſſize, that is by firſt laying apart <hi>⅓</hi> part of beſt Flower for White, <hi>3</hi> for Wheaten, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for Houſhold, as appears by the following Try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>They own that their Neat Meal and Barm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produced <hi>46 ½</hi> times <hi>150</hi> Ounces, which is the rule of Aſſize that day for the Twelve Penny Loaf, and the whole <hi>6975</hi> Ounces. Therefore had they Divided their Meal in Three parts, <hi>viz. 2325</hi> Ounces for White, as much for Wheaten, and as much for Houſhold, it would have produced as follows.</p>
